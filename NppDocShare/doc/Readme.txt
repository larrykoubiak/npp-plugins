Installing:
-	-
As always, dump the plugin in the plugin folder, or hope it was bundled with the Notepad++ 
distribution. Make sure the Unicode version is only used with Unicode Notepad++ (same with 
ANSI, ANSI can be recognised with the 'A' in the filename).

Usage:
-	-
Use the toolbar button or the menu to show the dialog. Click Serve or Connect (depending if 
you want to share a document or connect to a shared one) to start sharing. If sharing, it will
take the active document. Connecting will create a new document that is a copy of the one 
being shared.
If you save the document, that will be a local copy. Reconnecting will create a new document 
again, it will not reopen the one saved. 
Remember, the server has the 'master file', you only get a shared copy.

More help:
-	-
Check the forums for common issues and create a new message.
If you like to submit a bug, please check if you have the latest and greatest version,
if it isnt already submitted (I hate duplicates) and if you can give a clear description.
(Unfortunatly, just saying 'It crashed with code 0xABCXYZ' isnt going to help much, the action
that led to the issue is far more valuable). A good way to reproduce the error is the best, 
fastest and easiest way to solve it.

Plugin started and (thus far) made by Harry (harrybharry@users.sourceforge.net).
Thanks to Don HO for helping me do some initial tests.

Issues/Limitations:
-	-
-Currently only one client allowed, so only two people can work on the same document at the
same time. You can try cloning the plugin, but its not the best thing to do (there will be 
conflicts).
-Cannot change text colours.
-Crappy chat interface (There are IM clients that do this job much better, its just there for
completeness).
-Crappy overall interface.
Dont ask for any of this, when I get to it I try to add it, I'm jsut beginning :)

This thing was made as a fun project. Therefore, I try to make it work right, but dont expect
miracles (there are other collaborative editors out there that were specifically designed 
from the ground up as such, but they lacked a little thing, they arent Notepad++ :]).
