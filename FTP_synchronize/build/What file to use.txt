There are now 2 files in the package. One file is Unicode, the other one is ANSI. 
I recommend the Unicode version on WinNT and later, and ANSI on Win9x/WinME.
Unicode:
  FTP_synchronize.dll
ANSI:
  FTP_synchronizeA.dll

you can still use the unicode version on Win9x if you have unicows.dll installed
