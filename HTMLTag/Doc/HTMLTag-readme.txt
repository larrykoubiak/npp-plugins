[Introduction]
This plug-in provides two core functions to Notepad++:
- HTML and XML tag matching, like 
- HTML entity encoding/decoding (example: é to &eacute;)

It originated in these requests on the Plugin Development forum on SourceForge.net:
- http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4284078
- https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4443898


[Installation]
As usual:  
Extract the DLL and accompanying files to the plugins folder under 
%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++ (or wherever you're running Notepad++ from) or %AppData%\Notepad++, and 
(re)start Np++.


[Usage]
- Ctrl+T to select the matching tag;
- Shift+Ctrl+T to select both tags and the entire contents in between. 

- Ctrl+E to encode all selected non-ASCII characters to their HTML entities;
- Shift+Ctrl+E to dEcode all selected HTML entities.

All options are available under the Plugins menu item 'HTML Tag'; the shortcut keys can be adjusted 
with the shortcut mapper.


[Files]
HTMLTag.dll	            The actual plug-in.
HTMLTag-entities.ini	This file contains the list(s) of entities that will be processed. For now,
                        only the list headed with [HTML 4] will be used.  This can be adjusted if 
						you want to use other entities.
