What does this program:

This sources contains a spell checker plugin for Notepad++ version 4.0.
It's more an interface, because GNU Aspell is needed.
With this plugin you could check your text by typos.

For generating the dll file use VC++ 6. The project is included.

If you create a new project for VC 8 or MinGW please sent me the
complete project. I will integrate it.
